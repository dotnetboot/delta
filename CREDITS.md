## Credits

Delta would not be where it is today without the help from some people in the
development community as a whole. 

* **Steve Schoger/Adam Wathan** - Their design tips helped me become slightly less
terrible at design than I ever have been before. Whilst I happily confess to not being
perfect, their fire design tips and series over at https://refactoringui.com have
helped me more than they realise.
* **Steve Schoger** - Another mention for Steve, but this time for his Zondicons
(https://www.zondicons.com/) icon set. This icon set is used exclusively within 
Delta and is 100% free for you to download.
