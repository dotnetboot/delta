Delta is a free (as in freedom *and* beer) administration template. This project
contains a professionally designed responsive layout (with source Sketch files) 
and a fully functioning, ready-to-roll, best-practice led Angular application.

As Delta is licensed under the MIT license, you can use it in your free or 
commercial products. Whether you're bootstrapping a start-up or creating a new
internal corporate tool, you can use Delta and get your project up and running
quickly.

Delta is brought to you by [**Dotnet Boot**](https://dotnetboot.com): a 
customisable, fully functional administrative panel with a profesionally 
developed, fully tested API that helps you focus on the important parts of your 
application.
